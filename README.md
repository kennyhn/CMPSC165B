# CMPSC 165B - Machine Learning
Made by Kenny Hoang Nguyen.
Course taken at University of California, Santa Barbara winter quarter 2020

#### HW1
Multivariable linear regression. Uses stochastic gradient descent of cost function f(x) = wx+b to find the best parameters w to fit the line to the training data. Got 80% accuracy

#### HW2
Classification using binary entropy to find the line that seperates the classes. stochastic gradient descent is also used here but the cost function is f(x) = sigmoid(wx+b). Got 77% accuracy

### HW3
Classification using decision trees. Find the split that maximizes the information gain.
Got approximately 80% accuracy on test set after training

### HW4
Unfinished code. Did not work.
